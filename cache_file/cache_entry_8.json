It can be viewed as a distributed transaction management system that assumes nodes behave in arbitrary (Byzantine) manners, offering stronger security than traditional databases. Private blockchains, used in settings where participants are authenticated, differ from public blockchains in their consensus protocols and support for smart contracts. They are particularly desirable in business and financial systems due to their deterministic consensus and complex transaction logic capabilities."}
