The adversarial examples were generated using the step l.l. method. The table shows the accuracy of the model in handling both clean and adversarial images. When k = 16, the model demonstrates a good trade-off between accuracy on clean images (77.6%) and adversarial images (75.3%). This is because, as k increases, the model becomes more robust against adversarial attacks, but its performance on clean images decreases. Conversely, as k decreases, the model's performance on clean images improves, but its robustness against adversarial attacks decreases."}
