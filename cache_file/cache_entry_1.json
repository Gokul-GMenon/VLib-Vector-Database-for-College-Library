It mentions that TF.Learn provides an easy-to-use Scikit-learn style interface for creating, configuring, training, evaluating, and experimenting with machine learning models. It also mentions that TF.Learn is a simplified interface for TensorFlow, and can help smooth the transition from using Scikit-learn to using TensorFlow.\n\nIn order to learn about Python, I would recommend starting with the basics of the language, such as data types, variables, loops, and functions. There are many resources available online for learning Python, including tutorials, documentation, and online courses. Some popular online platforms for learning Python include Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera. It is also helpful to practice writing Python code regularly, and to work on projects that will allow you to apply what you have learned."}
