It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware. The OS provides a user-friendly environment to run other programs, and handles resource allocation, I/O operations, file system manipulation, and communication between different parts of the system. Examples of OS include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, and iOS."}
