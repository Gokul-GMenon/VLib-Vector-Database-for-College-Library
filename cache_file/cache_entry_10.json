However, to answer your query, I can suggest some resources to learn Python:\n\n1. Codecademy: Offers a free Python course that covers the basics of Python programming.\n2. Coursera: Provides a Python course as a part of their Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University.\n3. w3schools: A website that offers Python tutorials with examples and exercises.\n4. Real Python: A website that offers a variety of Python tutorials and courses for different levels.\n5. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: A free online book that teaches Python by automating tasks.\n6. Python Crash Course: A book by Eric Matthes that covers Python basics and projects.\n\nThese resources should help you get started with learning Python."}
