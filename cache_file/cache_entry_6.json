This is because Python's standard implementations compile source code to an intermediate format known as byte code and then interpret the byte code, rather than being compiled all the way down to binary machine code. However, the text also notes that Python code runs fast enough in most application domains and that modern computer speeds often make the speed-of-development gain more important than any speed-of-execution loss. Additionally, for domains that require optimal execution speeds, compiled extensions can be linked into a Python system for use in Python scripts."}
