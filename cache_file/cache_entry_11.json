These include investigations into the molecular dynamics of tautomerism in acetone solution (182), lithium and sodium insertion in carbon materials (184, 185), and the development of machine learning calculators for the lithium-graphite system (186). There are also studies on Jahn-Teller distortions and phase transitions in LiNiO2 (187), interatomic potential effects on fracture behavior in tungsten (188), and self-diffusion in molybdenum (189). Other studies focus on niobium mechanical properties (190), bond-order potentials for refractory metals (191), and angular-dependent interatomic potentials for ternary alloys (192). Studies on point defect structures in body-centered cubic metals (193), dislocation core properties in metals and semiconductors (194), and machine learning potentials for crystal defects in bcc Fe and W (195, 197) are also mentioned."}
