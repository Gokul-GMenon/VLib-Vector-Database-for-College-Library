They are produced in nuclear reactions, such as those that occur in the sun, stars, and nuclear reactors. Neutrinos come in three types or \"flavors\": electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos. They can change between these flavors in a process called neutrino oscillation. This ability to change flavors has important implications for our understanding of the fundamental properties of neutrinos and the role they play in the universe."}
