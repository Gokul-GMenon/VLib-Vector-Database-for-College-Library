It consists of a \ufb01nite set of states, an input alphabet, a transition function that maps each state and input symbol to a next state, an initial state, and a set of \ufb01nal states. The DFA reads an input string one symbol at a time, transitioning from state to state according to the transition function, and accepts the input string if the \ufb01nal state is reached. DFAs are used in various applications such as lexical analysis, pattern recognition, and text processing."}
