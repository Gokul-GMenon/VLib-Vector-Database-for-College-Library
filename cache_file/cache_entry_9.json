The table shows the accuracy of the models in recognizing clean images and adversarial examples generated using the step l.l. method. The results indicate that as the number of adversarial examples in the minibatch increases, the model's accuracy on clean images decreases, while its accuracy on adversarial examples increases. The paper suggests that k = 16 is a reasonable trade-off between accuracy on clean and adversarial images. This concept can be related to finite automata in the sense that both involve finding a balance between accuracy and efficiency, as finite automata aim to recognize patterns in strings while minimizing the number of states."}
