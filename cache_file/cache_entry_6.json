The long-term scheduler, also known as the job scheduler, selects processes from the disk and loads them into memory for execution, controlling the degree of multi-programming. It is invoked less frequently and must select a good mix of I/O bound and CPU bound processes. The short-term scheduler, also known as the CPU scheduler, selects from among the ready-to-execute processes and allocates the CPU to one of them. It must be very fast due to the short duration of time between executions. The medium-term scheduler, also known as the swap scheduler, removes processes from memory and swaps them back in later, reducing the degree of multi-programming and improving the process miss rate or freeing up memory when the available memory limit is exceeded."}
