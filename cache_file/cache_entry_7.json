It has three primary methods: Enqueue (add an item at the back), Dequeue (retrieve and remove the item at the front), and Peek (retrieve the item at the front without removing it). Queues can be efficiently implemented using a singly linked list, providing O(1) insertion and deletion run time complexities.\n\nThere are variations of the queue data structure, such as the priority queue, which orders items based on priority, and the double-ended queue (deque), which allows access to items at both the front and back. Priority queues can be implemented using a heap data structure, while deques have no prioritization strategy and allow items to be added in order to either the front or back."}
