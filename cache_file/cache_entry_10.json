They are used to synchronize and time the operations of the CPU, allowing it to execute instructions and process data in a consistent and orderly manner. Each clock cycle can be thought of as a single \"tick\" of the CPU's clock, and the speed of the clock (measured in hertz) determines how many of these ticks occur per second. For example, a CPU with a clock speed of 3 gigahertz (3 GHz) will have a clock cycle time of 1/3,000,000,000 of a second, or about 0.333 nanoseconds.\n\nIn the context of the book excerpt you provided, the number of CPU clock cycles needed to transfer a character from the keyboard to the INPR register will depend on the clock speed of the CPU and the specific details of the computer's architecture. The clock pulses that are used to synchronize this transfer are provided by the CPU's master clock, which is independent of the clock signals used by serial interfaces such as RS232, USB, and Firewire. These interfaces have their own clock signals, which are used to synchronize the transmission and reception of data over the serial connection. The INPR and OUTR registers are shift registers, which are used to temporarily store data as it is being transferred between the CPU and an input or output device. The FGI and FGO flip-flops are used to indicate when new input is ready to be transferred to the CPU or when the terminal has finished displaying the last character sent, respectively. These flip-flops must be set and cleared by the I/O interface and the CPU, respectively, in order to properly synchronize the transfer of data."}
