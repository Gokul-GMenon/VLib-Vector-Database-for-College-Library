Conditional flags like Carry (CY), Auxiliary Carry (AC), Parity (PF), Zero (ZF), and Sign (SF) are modified automatically during mathematical operations. Control flags, such as Trap Flag (TF), Interrupt Flag (IF), and Direction Flag (DF), are set or reset deliberately to control the operations of the execution unit. The 8086 microprocessor is designed to increase memory addressing capability, increase execution speed, provide a powerful instruction set, and facilitate programming in high-level languages."}
