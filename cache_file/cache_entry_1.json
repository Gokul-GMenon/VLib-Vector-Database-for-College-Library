Every machine on the Internet has a unique IP address, which is used to identify it and send data to it. This data is sent in packets, which contain the IP addresses of the source and destination machines, as well as a checksum to ensure the data wasn't corrupted in transit. The IP address can be converted to a more memorable name using a DNS server. When connecting to another machine, such as when reading a web page, the IP address is used to exchange data with that machine. The data may be broken down into smaller packets for easier handling and transmitted over the connection media. The destination host must then reassemble the packets before giving the data to the receiving application."}
