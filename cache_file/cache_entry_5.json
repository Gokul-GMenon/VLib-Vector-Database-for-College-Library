The long-term scheduler, also known as the job scheduler, selects processes from the disk and loads them into memory for execution, controlling the degree of multi-programming. It is invoked less frequently than other schedulers. The short-term scheduler, also known as the CPU scheduler, selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them. It must be very fast due to the short duration of time between executions. The medium-term scheduler is an intermediate level scheduler that removes processes from memory and reduces the degree of multi-programming. It is responsible for swapping processes in and out of memory as needed."}
