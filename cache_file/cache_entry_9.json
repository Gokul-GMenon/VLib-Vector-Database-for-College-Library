This process reduces network traffic and latency, improving the user experience. The challenge with HTTP caching lies in determining when a cached copy of a page is still valid and can be safely reused, as opposed to requiring a new fetch. This is because web resources can change over time, and the client needs to ensure it is using the most up-to-date version. HTTP provides built-in support for caching through headers like Last-Modified, Expires, and ETag, which help clients determine the freshness and uniqueness of cached resources."}
