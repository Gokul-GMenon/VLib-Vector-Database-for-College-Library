In computer science, syntax trees are often used in the implementation of programming languages, where they are built by parsing the source code and used to evaluate expressions or generate executable code. The root of the syntax tree represents the entire input string, while the children of each node represent the constituent parts of the input that contribute to the meaning of the parent node. The leaves of the tree represent the individual tokens of the input string, such as keywords, identifiers, and literals."}
