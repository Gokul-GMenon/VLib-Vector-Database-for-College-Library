It consists of a \ufb01nite set of states, an input alphabet, a transition function, an initial state, and a set of \ufb01nal states. The transition function maps each state and input symbol to a single next state, allowing for deterministic behavior. DFAs are used to recognize regular languages and are fundamental to the study of formal languages and automata theory."}
