Examples include Proof-of-Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, which selects a random node to append a block based on computing power, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), used by Hyperledger, which uses a communication-bound protocol to tolerate failures. Hybrid designs, such as Bitcoin-NG and Tendermint, combine the scalability of PoW with the safety property of PBFT."}
