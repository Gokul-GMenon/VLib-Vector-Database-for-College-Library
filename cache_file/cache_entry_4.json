They convert glucose and oxygen into a form of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process called cellular respiration. This energy is used to power the cell's activities and functions. Mitochondria also play a role in other cellular processes, such as the regulation of cell growth and death. They are often referred to as the \"powerhouse\" of the cell."}
